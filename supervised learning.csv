Severity: benign=0 or malignant=1 (binominal)     BI-RADS is an assesment of how confident the severity classification is; it is not a ""predictive"" attribute and so we will discard it. The age, shape, margin, and density attributes are the features that we will build our model with, and ""severity"" is the classification we will attempt to predict based on those attributes.  Although ""shape"" and ""margin"" are nominal data types, which sklearn typically doesn't deal with well, they are close enough to ordinal that we shouldn't just discard them. The ""shape"" for example is ordered increasingly from round to irregular.  A lot of unnecessary anguish and surgery arises from false positives arising from mammogram results.

Mammographic-Mass-Classification-HealthCare-Industry-Future-prediction.,"Predict whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant We'll be using the ""mammographic masses"" public dataset from the UCI repository (source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass)  This data contains 961 instances of masses detected in mammograms, and contains the following attributes:  BI-RADS assessment: 1 to 5 (ordinal) Age: patient's age in years (integer) Shape: mass shape: round=1 oval=2 lobular=3 irregular=4 (nominal) Margin: mass margin: circumscribed=1 microlobulated=2 obscured=3 ill-defined=4 spiculated=5 (nominal) Density: mass density high=1 iso=2 low=3 fat-containing=4 (ordinal) Severity: benign=0 or malignant=1 (binominal) BI-RADS is an assesment of how confident the severity classification is; it is not a ""predictive"" attribute and so we will discard it. The age, shape, margin, and density attributes are the features that we will build our model with, and ""severity"" is the classification we will attempt to predict based on those attributes.  Although ""shape"" and ""margin"" are nominal data types, which sklearn typically doesn't deal with well, they are close enough to ordinal that we shouldn't just discard them. The ""shape"" for example is ordered increasingly from round to irregular.  A lot of unnecessary anguish and surgery arises from false positives arising from mammogram results. If we can build a better way to interpret them through supervised machine learning, it could improve a lot of lives.",Dineshsagar,[],https://github.com/Dineshsagar/Mammographic-Mass-Classification-HealthCare-Industry-Future-prediction.,https://api.github.com/users/Dineshsagar,https://api.github.com/repos/Dineshsagar/Mammographic-Mass-Classification-HealthCare-Industry-Future-prediction.,Hyderabad

Finding_Donors,"Finding Donors for CharityML . CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.",MarahAshayer,[],https://github.com/MarahAshayer/Finding_Donors,https://api.github.com/users/MarahAshayer,https://api.github.com/repos/MarahAshayer/Finding_Donors,"Tulkarm , Palestine"

This is unsupervised learning and it's much more of an exploratory task. Rather than wanting to classify with our model, the goal in unsupervised learning is to explore the data to find insights. we will look at clustering news articles to find trends and patterns in the data.

To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail.

predict-charity-doners-using-regression-models,"In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features.  The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article ""Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"".

Although Cryptocurrencies have been tagged by financial experts as the future of transactions, Bitcoin, which is the most popular and acceptable cryptocurrency has a very  volatile price trend, making it challenging for this method of transaction to gain the trust of its users. By providing accurate predictions of Bitcoin prices, we intend  increasing the trust of both those who simply use cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions or investors seeking to make profits from Bitcoin as every other money market.

Hypothyroid-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms,"Currently, hypothyroid disorders are more common and widespread among women worldwide. In India, seven out of 10 women are suffering from thyroid problems every day. Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose thyroid problems at the earlier stage. Machine learning (ML) algorithms provide a simple way to solve problems in medical data analysis. Several researchers used various ML algorithms for hypothyroid classification without feature reduction.  Here we proposed three supervised ML namely Random forest, Logistic regression and LightGBM classifier along with feature reduction.  We enhance the results using the LightGBM, with few changes in hyper parameters. The hypothyroid dataset with 3164 instances and 25 features taken from kaggle and experiment is conducted on with (17 features under physician guidance) and without (all 25 features) feature reduction. The novelty in this work is feature reduction with the help of physician guidance and few changes in lightGBM classifier. The overall prediction depends on the target variable which is divided into hypothyroid and normal class. The confusion matrix is a key mechanism to analyse hypothyroidism dataset. Experimental Results shows that Light GBM gives the highest accuracy 99.84% for 25 features and 98.89% for 17 features. Even small changes in accuracy will provide a big impact in medical decision support systems. This proposed lightGBM classifier method can be used for better prediction of hypothyroid disease.",ArunadeviRamesh,[],https://github.com/ArunadeviRamesh/Hypothyroid-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms,https://api.github.com/users/ArunadeviRamesh,https://api.github.com/repos/ArunadeviRamesh/Hypothyroid-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms,Madurai
CharityML,"In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features.  The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article ""Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"".

Project--Finding-Donors-With-CharityML-,"In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census.

Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features.  The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Nowadays, the usage of cars in our day to day lives increased significantly; An automated, accurate license plate recognition system is needed for traffic control and law enforcement of traffic regulation. In this project, we have developed a License Plate Recognition System, by reviewing the previous methodology for detecting the number plate. This system is designed using both image processing and machine learning techniques. The captured image is preprocessed using techniques like grayscale conversion and image and binarization, which can be done using Otsu’s threshold method. Binarized image is used as input for localization of number plate area, detection, and extraction of the license plate is done using morphological operations. In the next step, characters are separated from the number plate, this can be achieved using morphological operations. Optical character  recognition is used for recognizing the segmented characters. k- Nearest Neighbors (KNN) supervised machine learning classifica- tion algorithm is used for optical character recognition. Finally,  the accuracy of the algorithm is calculated we have got 80.7% accuracy for the data set containing total 1062 images.",skrchinthalapally,[],https://github.com/skrchinthalapally/Automatic_number_plate_detection_system,https://api.github.com/users/skrchinthalapally,https://api.github.com/repos/skrchinthalapally/Automatic_number_plate_detection_system,"Vancouver,BC"
Reducing-Traffic-Mortality-in-the-USA,"While the rate of fatal road accidents has been decreasing steadily since the 80s, the past ten years have seen a stagnation in this reduction. Coupled with the increase in number of miles driven in the nation, the total number of traffic related-fatalities has now reached a ten year high and is rapidly increasing. By looking at the demographics of traﬃc accident victims for each US state, we find that there is a lot of variation between states. Now we want to understand if there are patterns in this variation in order to derive suggestions for a policy action plan. In particular, instead of implementing a costly nation-wide plan we want to focus on groups of states with similar profiles. How can we find such groups in a statistically sound way and communicate the result effectively?

CustomerAttrition-FinalYearProject,"Customer churn or customer attrition occurs when certain customers are no longer loyal to a firm. In retail businesses, the event of churn is said to occur, if a customer's transactions terminates after a certain duration. High churn rates incur humungous losses for the businesses as it is observed that acquiring new buyers is costlier than retaining the current customer base. Hence, for calculating customer churn of companies, they should be able to monitor churn rates. These churn rates give an organization various factors to be considered to determine their customer retention success rates and identify strategies for improvement. Customer churn is predicted using Pareto/NBD model. Once the customers who are likely to churn are predicted, they need to be differentiated based on their previous purchasing history. Natural Language Processing is used to model product categorization. Semi- supervised learning does customer segmentation. This consists of assigning a score by RFM model and segmenting using k-means clustering. The prediction of clusters is then done using algorithms like logistic regression, SVM and SGD classifier. These methods are collectively used to build a suitable recommendation system, which is targeted to make the churn customers who were valuable to the company.",punyashetty,[],https://github.com/punyashetty/CustomerAttrition-FinalYearProject,https://api.github.com/users/punyashetty,https://api.github.com/repos/punyashetty/CustomerAttrition-FinalYearProject,Bengaluru
A-Performance-Comparison-of-ML-Classification-Techniques-in-Document-Classification,"In this task, a data-set is used that comprise of different jobs posted on a job portal. The data-set was downloaded from Kaggle. It had the following basic properties:  It was provided in .csv format. The data-set simulated the real life scenario of jobs posted on a job portal and comprised of Job's title, Job's description along with its category As the data was labeled so in the context of machine learning, it was a Supervised Machine learning problem i.e. I had access to the data that was already correctly labeled and I had to train a model using this historical data. The main goal was to build a model that could accurately classify new and unseen data when it was input to it i.e. to assign proper label to a job posting when its input to the model. As the nature of the data was ""text"" so this project also involved extensive usage of text mining techniques as well. Text in its basic form is unstructured and to develop predictive models, the data needs to be thoroughly pre-processed. So the pipeline of developing models that I followed was: Data Profiling Data Cleansing Exploratory Analysis Data Preprocessing Feature Extraction and Selection Model Development Model Evaluation When text data is pre-processed, the issue of curse of dimensionality usually appears i.e. data becomes highly multi-dimensional with lots of features ranging in thousands. Not all of those features are helpful and also it adversely affects the peformance of classifiers as well so following the best practices, I opted for best-in-class feature extraction methods and also applied feature selection techniques so as to compile only those features that will contribute in this prediction problem. For model development, I used and compared the following set of machine learning algorithms:  Bernoulli Naive Bayes Multinomial Naive Bayes Random Forests Linear SVM and compared these algorithms on different metrics like accuracy, training and testing time. As per my analysis, SVM outshines all of the other models when it comes to accuracy. Random Forests accuracy score was also quite good but took considerable time during training phase. For implementation, I used Python. Specifically, I used the following libraries/modules of Python for different set of tasks: pandas, numpy sklearn nltk matplotlib  To run the code, please make sure that the latest version of Python, Jupyter and aforementioned libraries are installed in your system.",Madres,[],https://github.com/Madres/A-Performance-Comparison-of-ML-Classification-Techniques-in-Document-Classification,https://api.github.com/users/Madres,https://api.github.com/repos/Madres/A-Performance-Comparison-of-ML-Classification-Techniques-in-Document-Classification,"New Delhi, India"

word_segmentation,"This challenge involves word segmentation for Mandarin Chinese. Words are not delimited by spaces in the standard orthography of Chinese, and therefore it becomes important for NLP tools to segment text into words before further processing (POS tagging, parsing, machine translation, text-to-speech, etc.). The same is true for a number of other widely-used scripts: Japanese, Thai, Tibetan, Lao, etc.  This can be thought of as a sequence tagging problem, where each character is assigned a tag: a 1 when the character is the final one in a word, and a 0 otherwise. With this setup, supervised learning approaches are quite effective, but they depend on the existence of hand-labeled training corpora. Given the huge amount of unsegmented Mandarin text available on the web, it is interesting to explore whether a system for word segmentation can be trained in an unsupervised fashion.",gregfromstl,[],https://github.com/gregfromstl/word_segmentation,https://api.github.com/users/gregfromstl,https://api.github.com/repos/gregfromstl/word_segmentation,"Pensacola, FL"
KNN-and-Deployment,"K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a type of supervised learning algorithm which is used for both regression and classification purposes, but mostly it is used for the later. Given a dataset with different classes, KNN tries to predict the correct class of test data by calculating the distance between the test data and all the training points. It then selects the k points which are closest to the test data. Once the points are selected, the algorithm calculates the probability (in case of classification) of the test point belonging to the classes of the k training points and the class with the highest probability is selected. In the case of a regression problem, the predicted value is the mean of the k selected training points.",Gaurav-1213,[],https://github.com/Gaurav-1213/KNN-and-Deployment,https://api.github.com/users/Gaurav-1213,https://api.github.com/repos/Gaurav-1213/KNN-and-Deployment,Pune

Learning,"Main article: Machine learning  For this project the AI had to find the typical patterns in the colors and brushstrokes of Renaissance painter Raphael. The portrait shows the face of the actress Ornella Muti, ""painted"" by AI in the style of Raphael. Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,[122] is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.[123][124]  Unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. Supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression, which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.[124] Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as ""function approximators"" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, ""spam"" or ""not spam"". Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[125] In reinforcement learning[126] the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.",Aryia-Behroziuan,[],https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/Learning,https://api.github.com/users/Aryia-Behroziuan,https://api.github.com/repos/Aryia-Behroziuan/Learning,IRAN

Supervised-learning,"Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.[38] The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[39] An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.[13]  Types of supervised learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.[40] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.  Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.",Aryia-Behroziuan,"['ai', 'artificial-intelligence', 'aryia', 'aryia-behroziuan', 'behroziuan', 'data-mining', 'supervised-learning']",https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/Supervised-learning,https://api.github.com/users/Aryia-Behroziuan,https://api.github.com/repos/Aryia-Behroziuan/Supervised-learning,IRAN

Prediction-of-Clinical-Risk-Factors-of-Diabetes-Using-ML-Resolving-Class-Imbalance,"Being the most common and rapidly growing disease, Diabetes affecting a huge number of people from all span of ages each year that reduces the lifespan. Having a high affecting rate, it increases the significance of initial diagnosis. Diabetes brings other complicated complications like cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, stroke, damaging the vital organs etc. Early diagnosis of diabetes reduces the likelihood of transiting it into a chronic and severe state. The identification and analysis of risk factors of different spinal attributes help to identify the prevalence of diabetes in medical diagnosis. The prevalence measure and identification of diabetes in the early stages reduce the chances of future complications. In this research, the collective NHANES dataset of 1999-2000 to 2015-2016 was used and the purposes of this research were to analyze and ascertain the potential risk factors correlated with diabetes by using Logistic Regression, ANOVA and also to identify the abnormalities by using multiple supervised machine learning algorithms. Class imbalance, outlier problems were handled and experimental results show that age, blood-related diabetes, cholesterol and BMI are the most significant risk factors that associated with diabetes.

neurons,"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.  The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.  Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[68]  Decision trees Main article: Decision tree learning Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.  Support vector machines Main article: Support vector machines Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.[69] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.   Illustration of linear regression on a data set. Regression analysis Main article: Regression analysis Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.  Bayesian networks Main article: Bayesian network  A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.  Genetic algorithms Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[73]  Training models Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.  Federated learning Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[74]  Applications There are many applications for machine learning, including:  Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive websites Affective computing Banking Bioinformatics Brain–machine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis[75] General game playing Handwriting recognition Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time series forecasting User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[81]  Limitations Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[85]  In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[87][88]  Bias Main article: Algorithmic bias Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[89] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[90][91] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.[92][93] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[94] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[95] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[96] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[97] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[98] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There’s nothing artificial about AI...It’s inspired by people, it’s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.”[99]  Model assessments Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[100]  In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).[101]  Ethics Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[102] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[103][104] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.  Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[105][106]  Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.[107]  Hardware Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.[108] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[109] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[110][111]  Software Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following:  Free and open-source so",Aryia-Behroziuan,"['an-ann', 'android', 'artificial-intelligence', 'aryia-behroziuan', 'bootstrap', 'csharp', 'deep-learning', 'expressjs', 'firebase', 'neural-network', 'wikipedia']",https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons,https://api.github.com/users/Aryia-Behroziuan,https://api.github.com/repos/Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons,IRAN

Robot-learning,"In developmental robotics, robot learning algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans. These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies and imitation.  Association rules Main article: Association rule learning See also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of ""interestingness"".[60]  Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[61] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.  Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.[62] For example, the rule {\displaystyle \{\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \}\Rightarrow \{\mathrm {burger} \}}\{{\mathrm  {onions,potatoes}}\}\Rightarrow \{{\mathrm  {burger}}\} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.  Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[63]  Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule-learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.  Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.[64][65][66] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.[67] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.  Models Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions. Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems.  Artificial neural networks Main article: Artificial neural network See also: Deep learning  An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain. Here, each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems ""learn"" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.  An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.

Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection,"Context It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.  Content The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.  It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.  Inspiration Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.  Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

DeepHashing,"Image hashing is the one-way process of converting an image into a binary hash such that similar images have similar hashes. This has promising applications in speeding up approximate nearest neighbor search when trying to retrieve similar images from a database as well as in security for verifying an image hasn’t been perceptually modified. Utilizing deep learning, we implement a model that learns these binary hashes under three primary constraints. First, we minimize the loss in information between the continuous model output and the quantized binary hash. Second, we make sure the binary values are distributed evenly on each bit. Third, we ensure different bits are as independent as possible through a relaxed orthogonality constraint on each fully connected layer of the model. In addition, we implement a variant of the same model that takes advantage of training data labeled for classification tasks in order to generate hashes that are near one another for images of the same class and far away for images of different classes.

Deep-Learning,"Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, machine vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog. The adjective ""deep"" in deep learning comes from the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, and then that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can on the other hand so be. Deep learning is a modern variation which is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability, whence the ""structured"" part.",aaaastark,[],https://github.com/aaaastark/Deep-Learning,https://api.github.com/users/aaaastark,https://api.github.com/repos/aaaastark/Deep-Learning,"Lahore, Pakistan"
